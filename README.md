# STEGANOGRAPHY
This project implements steganography to hide secret data (text/files) within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. It ensures secure data embedding while maintaining the imageâ€™s appearance. Built with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy for encoding and decoding hidden messages in images.
